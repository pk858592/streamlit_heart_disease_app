## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a trained Machine Learning model to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on clinical features such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- And more...

The model is deployed using **Streamlit** for interactive user input and real-time prediction.
